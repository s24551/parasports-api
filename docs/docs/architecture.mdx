# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

The API is built using a layered architecture:

1. **Routes Layer**
   - Handles HTTP requests
   - Implements REST endpoints
   - Manages request validation

2. **Controllers Layer**
   - Contains business logic
   - Processes requests
   - Prepares responses

3. **Models Layer**
   - Defines data structures
   - Implements data validation
   - Manages relationships between entities

4. **GraphQL Layer**
   - Implements types and resolvers
   - Handles queries and mutations
   - Provides advanced filtering capabilities

## Data Flow
1. Client makes a request (REST or GraphQL)
2. Request is validated and processed
3. Business logic is applied
4. Response is formatted and returned

## Security
- CORS configuration for secure cross-origin requests
- Input validation
- Error handling
